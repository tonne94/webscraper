java 11

in class ScheduledSpringConfig.java in @Scheduled you can set cron job, or like its done fixed rate of 10 minutes

in application.properties you can set your own filter, jsut go to njuskalo and set a filter you
want and copy it to this file without www.njuskalo.hr part, it works for oglasnik too

enjoy
